This is my template for making modded modules for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes! Feel free to use it if you wish :)

I have a guide for beginners to mod-making [here](https://github.com/TheKuroEver/KTaNE-Module-Template/wiki) with its own template. **This is a different template; it is the one that I personally use, and it does not have all the same content as the one from the guide. If you would like to use the guide, be sure to download the correct template!**

This is a fork of the [Community fork of the KTaNE Modkit](https://github.com/Qkrisi/ktanemodkit).

To get more help, join the [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://discord.gg/ktane) or the [KTaNE Modding](https://discord.gg/qzy7Gdz) Discord servers.
